            <!-- <img src = "../images/crystalPic.JPG" class = "mePicture"> -->
            <p>Valley Perforating originated as part of the facility known as Servco Services.  
               In 1968, Smith International bought Servco and phased out perforating in 1969.</p>
            <p>The perforating shop remained in Bakersfield and in 1970 began to operate under the name Valley Perforating Company. 
                Since buying the company, the new owners have upgraded the company's equipment and capabilities.  
                In 2005, Mike Dover, an employee of 27 years, and partner purchased the company.</p>
            <p>Valley Perforating is committed to continual improvement to satisfy our customer's needs. We are now an ISO 9001,2015 5CT approved facility with ISO 9002 quality procedures, and have added CNC mill and threading equipment. 
               Our shop operates 24 hours per day to better serve our customers.</p>
